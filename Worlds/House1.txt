%Hello friend; come hither.
%Dost thou see the goblin affliction plaguing our community?
%Of course thou dost.
%Get thee hence, far to the north; I hear talk of strange powers.
%Lo, a black wraith has been seen haunting Norstaff.
%Few who dare to enter that dark forest return to tell the tale.
%A bitter wind sweeps through the woods at night,
%do not get caught among the trees following sundown.
%Yet thou must brave this forest, 
%and end the reign of the fell wraith.
%With its passing will go the goblins.
Alas, the wraith's not likely to slay itself my boy,
Have courage, get up and hump thyself!
