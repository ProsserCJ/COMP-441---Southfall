Hi son, it's been a while! 
I knew if I just stayed in here you'd show up.
You're right on track to becoming a drunk like your Pa,
but unfortunately our town is in grave danger.
Since I'm exorbitantly lazy, I have a task I need you to do for me.
Go down south south-east to the other tavern and look for a man by the name of..
hmm...
Bags! I can't remember his name, but I'm sure you'll be able to find him.
Ask him what you can do for him.
Then go home and talk to Ma, she'll know what to do.
